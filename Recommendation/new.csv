What makes Puroast Coffee so deliciously healthy is our unique roasting process. Our beans are roasted slowly in a wood-fire,which is traditional of Venezuelan coffee farmers. This process allows each bean to roast on its own,producing a range of flavors that are both subtle and full-bodied. The Puroast roasting process also reduces bitter elements that are often caused by other,conventional roasting methods. This in turn reduces the acid content of all our Puroast Coffees. In addition to the health benefits low acidity provides,it also &ldquo;unmasks&rdquo; the true flavor of the bean.,Ingredients:The only ingredient in Puroast Coffee is 100 premium ground coffee beans.
